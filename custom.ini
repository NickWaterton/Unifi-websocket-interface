#This apples to any device section, you can use generic names, they will get converted to device ID's in the order they are received from the Unifi
#controller, or you can use device ID's directly (they are listed when you run the program).
#If you use device ID's, then you can change the location of specific devices.
#If you don't define an item, then it doesn't get drawn. ie if you have 3 switches, but only define 2, then only 2 are drawn.

#Slightly unusual, the character '(' is defined as a delimiter, so you can write 5a21c063cd10ff055a0f7b3b (Unifi PoE Switch) = (400,10,30,1)
#so it's nicer looking. So DON'T use '(' in a random identifier eg switch(1) = (400,10,30,1) would be bad (might still work though).
#The value is then split out at '='. ':' is not supported as a delimiter

#If you specify a negative number of x, this gives you an indent from the right (not an absolute x position). eg (-10,10,50,1) would give you an indent of
#10 from the right hand edge. Useful for switches, if you want them displayed vertically.
